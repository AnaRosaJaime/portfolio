      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ana Jaime, a Full-Stack Software Engineer with more than 14 years of experience building
        scalable, performant, and maintainable applications across multiple industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a strong background in both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I
        specialize in React, TypeScript, and component libraries with a focus on design systems and
        micro frontends. On the backend, I’ve worked with Node.js, Python, .NET, and databases like
        MongoDB and SQL Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve contributed to the development of platform tools, internal frameworks, and shared
        libraries used across large organizations. I’ve also taken part in architectural decisions,
        CI/CD integrations, and frontend communities, always with a focus on code quality and
        cross-team collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently open to new opportunities where I can bring my experience to complex web
        projects, especially those requiring strong frontend structure combined with solid backend
        logic. You can also check out some of my work on{' '}
